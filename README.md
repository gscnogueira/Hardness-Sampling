# Hardness Sampling

This repository contains the code and data used for the experiments described in the paper **"Hardness Sampling: Exploring Instance Hardness in Pool-based Active Learning"**. 
The repository structure is organized to facilitate reproducing the experiments and analyzing the results.

## Repository Structure

Below is an overview of the main folders and files in the repository:
- [datasets](datasets/): contains the datasets used in the experiments.
- [experiments](experiments/) Scripts and configurations for running experiments.
- [logs](logs/) Log files generated during experiment runs.
- [notebooks](notebooks/) Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and interactive experiments
- [results](results/) Results generated after running the experiments
- [scripts](scripts/) Helper scripts for data preporcessing, experiment execution, etc.

## Requirements

- **Python Version**: 3.8.19
- **Libraries**: Listed in the `requirements.txt` file

## Credits

This project was developed to support the paper **Hardness Sampling: Exploring Instance Hardness in Pool-based Active Learning** by Gabriel da S. C. Nogueira, Davi, P. dos Santos, and Lu√≠s P. F. Garcia.
